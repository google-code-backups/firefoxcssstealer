== Communication ==

The primarily means of communication for our team was email. We did not use the mailing list since there were just three people on our team. 

On-line methods of communication also didn't work for us, since we had different schedules and most members of our group could not use IM at work.

We had group meetings every week (or twice a week), so face to face communication was also quite important. 

As for team dynamics, we did not have any conflicts and everybody made a somewhat equal contribution into the project. We divided the work into three parts at the beginning of the project, but as the development went along, we tried to redistribute the work load and solve some problems from different angles. For examples, there was an issue with the right and back slashes in the file path, that were reconginzed in Windows, but did not work in Linux. We tried to solve the issue from JavaScript code, as well as from C++ code. So, two people were working simulteneously on the problem. At the end we found a solution in using built in Mozilla components.
